A small gem which provides a retry-method for Eventmachine. Synopsis:

  EM.run do
    i=0
    EM.with_retries 1,2,3 do
      Kernel.puts "trial #{i+=1}"
    end
  end

Also included is a convenience wrapper for existing methods. Synopsis:

  class A
    extend EMRetryMethod
    
    def foo
      puts 'foo'
    end
    retry_method :foo, 1,2,3
  end

Every call to #foo will be retried after 1, another 2 and another 3 seconds before giving up.

NOTE: ONLY WORKS WITH RUBY 1.9
